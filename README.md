To host your single-page app on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
   - Name your repository (e.g., `random-fact-generator`) and add a description if you like.
   - Choose "Public" for the visibility.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file if you want.
   - Click "Create repository."

2. **Upload Your Files:**
   - If you initialized with a README, you can upload your files directly by clicking "Add file" > "Upload files."
   - Drag and drop your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into the repository.
   - Commit the changes by clicking "Commit changes."

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
   - Scroll down to the "Pages" section.
   - Under "Source," select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - If you have your files in the root directory, leave the folder as `/ (root)`.
   - Click "Save."

4. **Access Your Site:**
   - After a few minutes, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
   - For example, if your username is `johnDoe` and your repository is `random-fact-generator`, your site will be at [https://johnDoe.github.io/random-fact-generator/](https://johnDoe.github.io/random-fact-generator/%60).

5. **Verify and Test:**
   - Visit the URL to ensure your app is working as expected.
   - If you encounter any issues, check the browser console for errors and ensure all file paths are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to host your single-page app on GitHub Pages successfully. Let me know if you need further assistance!
